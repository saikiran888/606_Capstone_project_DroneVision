# üöÅ DroneVision - Secure Drone Segmentation for Rescue and Defence üõ°Ô∏è

**Team Members:**
- Saikiran Mandula - LN73970
- Bharath Kumar Gopu - EY53339

## üìä Research Question
How can drone-captured aerial images be used to segment and detect critical objects (such as people, vehicles, and infrastructure) to assist in faster and more efficient rescue and defense operations?

---

## üìñ Background
In response to the increasing demand for rapid and precise actions in **rescue** and **defense operations**, drones offer a promising solution for capturing real-time aerial imagery. The challenge, however, lies in accurately identifying and segmenting key objects from this data. This project aims to develop a system that processes drone images for **object detection** and **segmentation**, with a focus on:
- Locating people during emergencies
- Spotting potential threats in restricted areas

The functionality will be expanded by incorporating a web app for user interaction and potential **Power BI integration** for data visualization.

## üß† Key Concepts
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Assigning labels to each pixel of an image for identifying objects and backgrounds.
- **Object Detection**: Detecting and classifying objects like people, vehicles, and infrastructure.
- **Rescue Operations**: Finding and saving people during disasters or emergencies.
- **Defense Surveillance**: Monitoring restricted areas for potential threats or unauthorized activity.

## üìÇ Dataset Information
**Dataset Name**: [Semantic Drone Dataset](https://www.tugraz.at/index.php?id=22387) 

**Dataset Description**:
- **Image Resolution**: 6000x4000px (24Mpx)
- **Altitude Range**: 5 to 30 meters
- **Training Set**: 400 high-resolution images
- **Test Set**: 200 high-resolution images
- **Semantic Classes**: 20 classes (including people, cars, vegetation, buildings)
